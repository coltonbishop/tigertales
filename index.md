## Elevator Pitch
TigerTales simplifies textbooks for Princeton students. The current marketplace for Princeton students to exchange textbooks consists of posts to a Facebook buy/sell page that is difficult and time consuming to monitor and keep up-to-date with. TigerTales streamlines textbook exchanges between students by providing a clear and simple interface that facilitates connections between buyers and sellers. Whether you are selling your books from a past semester or purchasing new ones for the next, TigerTales can help you… 

Save Time and Energy! 
TigerTales constantly monitors the Princeton textbook exchange market and provides notifications in real time to students if the books they are searching for become available.

Save Money! 
TigerTales’ interface allows for users to view pricing statistics for the books they’re purchasing to ensure that they are paying a fair price. 

Save Face!
Our CAS authenticated user accounts and review system ensure authenticity and accountability which helps to protect our users from fraud and exploitation.

TigerTales let’s you devote your time and energy to reading those textbooks rather than hunting them down. Join today!
