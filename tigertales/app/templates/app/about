	<p>Thank you for using our website!</p>
	<p align="left">This is a group project for COS 333: Advanced Programming Techniques by
		Morlan Osgood, Sonia Hashim, Colton Bishop, Annette Chu and Ben Yap. At
		TigerTales, our mission is to facilitate the textbook exchange process to
		save both buyers and sellers time and effort. Previously, Princeton students
		have been buying and selling textbooks in a Facebook group, Textbook Exchange.
		However, the system was disorganized and users had to scroll through a long
		list of books to find the specific ones they want. With TigerTales, students
		can now easily search for the textbooks they need by entering their courses
		and they can even set up notifications to be notified when a book they are looking
		for pops up on the market.</p>
	<p align="left">We have done this by implementing several key features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li align="left">Search capabilities on the home page</li>
		<li align="left">Customized booklist for your schedule</li>
		<li align="left">Customized notifications for only the books you want</li>
		<li align="left">Separate pages to keep track of the books you're buying and selling</li>
	</p></ul>
	<p align="left">
		<b> To begin: </b> <br>
		You can access TigerTales at tigertales.herokuapp.com. On the landing page,
		click “Log In” and you will be asked to provide your netID and password to
		be authenticated via CAS. On your first login, you will be asked to fill out
		a simple form to provide us with necessary contact and course information.
		For each course that you add, you can choose which books you want to be
		notified about. If you enable notifications for a book, you will receive an
		email when a user adds a listing of that book to the market. Click save
		after you finish.</p>
		<p align="left">
		<b> To buy: </b> <br>
		You can return to the homepage to browse through all the listings on the
		market. To look for listings for a specific course, use the search feature
		on the sidebar. *You can enter the course code, course name or even the book
		name to search for it*. Click on each listing to view more information, like
		the book condition and prices on Labyrinth and Amazon. If you find a listing
		that you are interested, add it to your favorites.</p>
		<p align="left">
		To access your favorites, click on the cart icon on the sidebar. For each
		listing you added, input your offer amount using the listed price as a guide
		and click submit. The seller will be notified with your contact information
		and offer price and this listing will be added to your requested books and
		removed from your favorites. If you are no longer interested in a listing,
		you can delete it from your favorites. </p>
		<p align="left">
		<b> To sell: </b><br>
		To sell a book, click on the price tag icon on the sidebar. Enter the book
		title, price and condition and add it to your active listings. Your listing
		will now be visible on the market. To remove a listing from the market,
		click on the listing in your active listings and delete it. When a buyer is
		interested in your book, you will receive an email notification along with
		their offer price and contact information. This listing will now appear in
		your pending transactions along with their offer and you can choose to
		accept or decline. </p>
		<p align="left">
		<b> To update profile: </b><br>
		To update your profile information, click on the settings icon on the sidebar
		and save your profile after you make changes. You can now log out from the
		system and wait to be notified about a book you want to buy or are selling!
